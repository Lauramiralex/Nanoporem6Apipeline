ImproperOutputException in rule align in file /vol/spacex/nanopore/test_pipeline/f/workflow/rules/aligner.py, line 2:
Outputs of incorrect type (directories when expecting files or vice versa). Output directories must be flagged with directory(). for rule align:
    output: /vol/spacex/nanopore/test_pipeline/f/itbs1/aligned.bam
    wildcards: output_dir=/vol/spacex/nanopore/test_pipeline/f, name=itbs, replicate=1
    affected files:

Removing output files of failed job align since they might be corrupted:
/vol/spacex/nanopore/test_pipeline/f/itbs1/aligned.bam
Skipped removing non-empty directory /vol/spacex/nanopore/test_pipeline/f/itbs1/aligned.bam
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
