MissingOutputException in rule align in file /vol/spacex/nanopore/test_pipeline/f/workflow/rules/aligner.py, line 2:
Job 9  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
/vol/spacex/nanopore/test_pipeline/f/itbs1/aligned/aligned.bam (missing locally, parent dir contents: basecalled.bam, basecalled.bam.bai, alignment_summary.txt)
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
